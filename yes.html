<p>At dawn, you reach the ancient archway and venture into the forest, where you confront Elderrich, a towering skeletal figure clutching the Heartstone.
<br> 
After a fierce battle, you dodge its attacks and defeat it with a decisive blow. As the creature crumbles, you claim the Heartstone, feeling its energy surge through you.
<br> 
A playful spirit appears, thanking you for freeing the gem from Elderrichâ€™s grasp and restoring balance to the forest.
<br>
With the Heartstone in hand, you return to Eldergrove, greeted by cheers from the townsfolk, marking the start of your legendary journey.
 <br>
 <br>
